        Node JS is a key player, and it has played a significant role in the
        popularity and extensive adoption of JavaScript. The acceptance of Node
        Js can be attributed to the efficiency and speed it provides to the
        development environment. Node Js makes it easy enough to get started,
        but moving forward to the core functionalities of your application,
        knowing how to structure your code and how to deal with errors gets
        difficult.
